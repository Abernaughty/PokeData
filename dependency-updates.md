  - Modified packageManager field in package.json
  - Installed pnpm 10.9.0 globally
  - Verified installation with `pnpm -v`
  - Updated Node.js engine requirement from >=14.0.0 to >=18.0.0
  - Created backup of lock file
  - Reinstalled dependencies with new pnpm version
  - Created test-build.bat script for testing

**Notes:**

- Using `echo y | pnpm install` to automatically confirm prompt

## Phase 2: Non-Breaking Minor Updates

  - rollup-plugin-svelte (7.0.0 → 7.2.2)
  - rollup-plugin-terser (7.0.0 → 7.0.2)
  - Verified latest versions using `pnpm info` commands
  - Note: Kept rollup-plugin-css-only at 3.1.0 for now to minimize changes
  - Note: Kept rimraf at 3.0.2 as newer versions (6.x) are major updates with potential breaking changes

**Notes:**
- Created test-phase2.bat script to test build and verify functionality
- Application builds successfully with updated dependencies
- Testing confirmed all functionality works correctly with new plugin versions

## Phase 3: Rollup Update

**Status: Completed on 2025-05-02**

- Updated Rollup and core plugins to their latest compatible versions:
  - Rollup (2.30.0 → 2.79.2) - latest in the 2.x series

  - @rollup/plugin-node-resolve (11.0.0 → 13.3.0) - latest compatible with Rollup 2.x
  - Carefully verified versions using `pnpm info` commands to identify the latest stable versions

**Notes:**
- Created test-phase3.bat script to test build and verify functionality
- Application builds successfully with updated dependencies
- Testing confirmed all functionality works correctly with new Rollup versions
- No configuration changes were needed despite the major version updates in plugins
- Build times remained similar or improved slightly

## Phase 4: Svelte Update (3.x to 4.x)

**Status: Completed on 2025-05-02**

- Updated Svelte from 3.38.3 to 4.2.19 (latest stable in the 4.x series)
- Fixed accessibility issues in components to comply with Svelte 4's stricter requirements:
  - Added ARIA roles to interactive elements
  - Added keyboard event handlers to elements with mouse event handlers
  - Fixed focus management in dropdown components
  - Added proper ARIA attributes for improved screen reader support
  - Fixed components with non-interactive elements that had event listeners

**Modified Components:**
- SearchableSelect.svelte
  - Added proper role="button" and tabindex to clear icon
  - Added keyboard handlers for non-mouse users
  - Added proper ARIA roles to dropdown items
  - Improved focus management
- CardSearchSelect.svelte
  - Similar accessibility improvements as SearchableSelect
  - Added ARIA roles and keyboard interaction
- CardVariantSelector.svelte
  - Fixed modal dialog accessibility
  - Added proper ARIA roles and attributes
  - Improved keyboard navigation

**Notes:**
- Created test-svelte4.bat script to test build and verify functionality
- Application builds successfully with Svelte 4
- No warnings or errors in the build process after accessibility fixes
- All functionality is working correctly after the upgrade
- Did not require any changes to the Svelte configuration in rollup.config.cjs

## Issues Encountered and Fixed

### Database Version Mismatch

**Issue:** After updating pnpm, the application was showing multiple IndexedDB errors in the console:
```
Error opening database: VersionError: The requested version (2) is less than the existing version (3).
```

**Root Cause:** The database in the browser was at version 3, but the code in `src/services/storage/db.js` was trying to open it with version 2.

**Fix:** Updated the `DB_VERSION` constant in `src/services/storage/db.js` from 2 to 3 to match the existing browser database version.

**Result:** Application now works correctly with no database errors. All database operations function properly, including set list loading, card data retrieval, and caching.

## Next Steps

### Phase 5: Major Version Updates
- Update to Rollup 4.x
- Update sirv-cli from 1.0.0 to latest version
- Full application testing

### Phase 6 (Optional): Svelte 5 Update
- Evaluate necessity and benefits vs. effort
- Update if beneficial
- Would require significant component refactoring for the runes system
