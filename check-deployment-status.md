# 🚀 Azure Functions Build Fix Deployment Status

## ✅ Changes Successfully Pushed to GitHub

**Commit**: `788669c` - Fix Azure Functions deployment: Resolve critical build configuration issue

### 🔧 What Was Fixed:
1. **Copy Script Source Path**: Fixed from `dist/functions` → `src/functions`
2. **Missing function.json Files**: Added to all source directories
3. **Validation Test**: Created comprehensive test script
4. **Azure Functions v4 Compatibility**: Maintained throughout

## 📋 How to Monitor the Deployment

### Option 1: GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to: https://github.com/Abernaughty/PokeData/actions
2. Look for the latest workflow run triggered by commit `788669c`
3. Monitor the "Deploy Azure Functions" workflow

### Option 2: Check Specific Workflows
- **Azure Functions Deployment**: `.github/workflows/azure-functions.yml`
- **Static Web Apps**: `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-calm-mud-07a7f7a10.yml`

## 🎯 Expected Results

### ✅ If Build Fix Works:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds
- ✅ Copy script finds function.json files in `src/functions/`
- ✅ All 4 functions deploy successfully to Azure
- ✅ Backend API becomes functional again
- ✅ No more ENOENT errors in CI/CD

### ❌ If Issues Remain:
- Check workflow logs for specific error messages
- Verify function.json files are present in build output
- Confirm copy script execution in build logs

## 🧪 Testing the Deployed Functions

Once deployment completes, test the endpoints:

```bash
# Test GetSetList
curl "https://pokedata-func.azurewebsites.net/api/sets"

# Test GetCardsBySet  
curl "https://pokedata-func.azurewebsites.net/api/sets/PRE/cards"

# Test GetCardInfo
curl "https://pokedata-func.azurewebsites.net/api/cards/73121"
```

## 📊 Validation Script

Run the validation script locally to confirm the fix:
```bash
node test-build-fix-validation.js
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
2. Verify all function.json files are in the deployment package
3. Confirm Azure Functions runtime can find both JS and JSON files
4. Review Azure Portal for function loading status
