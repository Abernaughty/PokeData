# Active Context

## Current Focus (January 10, 2025)
Completed comprehensive improvements to deploy.bat script - now fully functional with authentication, clean output, and robust testing.

### Latest Updates (Just Completed - Final Version)
1. **Fixed .env File Parsing**:
   - Changed to `usebackq tokens=1,* delims==` for reliable parsing
   - Properly handles keys with special characters
   - Shows key prefix for verification (first 10 chars)
   - Script exits if staging key missing to prevent 401 errors

2. **Clean Output Implementation**:
   - All curl commands use `-o nul` to suppress JSON payloads
   - Only shows HTTP status codes for readability
   - Removed verbose debug messages after confirming functionality
   - Much cleaner deployment output for easier navigation

3. **Function Key Authentication Working**:
   - Successfully loads `AZURE_FUNCTION_KEY_STAGING` from .env
   - Successfully loads `PRODUCTION_FUNCTION_KEY` from .env
   - All endpoints properly authenticated with host keys
   - Manual test URLs include keys for browser testing

4. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Staging tests: `/api/sets`, `/api/sets/557/cards`, `/api/sets/557/cards/73121`
   - Production tests: Same endpoints with production key after swap
   - 3-retry warm-up logic with 30-second intervals
   - Clear success/failure indicators

### Script Execution Issues Fixed
- Added `call` prefix to all `func` and `az` commands to prevent premature exit
- Fixed timeout command (no more "input redirection not supported" errors)
- Corrected RESTful API endpoint URLs throughout script
- Authentication now working with proper host keys (not function keys)

### CI/CD Pipeline Improvements
- **Staging Deployment**: All deployments now go to staging slot first
- **Health Checks**: Automated verification after each deployment
- **Manual Approval Gates**: Production deployments require explicit approval
- **Single-Flow deploy.bat**: Complete staging→test→production in one execution (now working correctly)
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: New deploy-function.yml with proper staging/production separation
- **Rollback Capability**: Previous version remains in staging for quick rollback

### Deployment Methods
1. **GitHub Actions** (Primary):
   - Push to main → Auto-deploy to staging → Manual approval → Swap to production
   - PR validation runs tests without deployment
   
2. **Local deploy.bat** (Secondary - Now Fixed):
   - Option 1: Safe deploy with staging→test→production flow (includes health checks and swap prompt)
   - Option 2: Emergency direct to production (bypass staging)
   - Option 3: Swap existing staging to production

### Key URLs
- Production: https://pokedata-func.azurewebsites.net
- Staging: https://pokedata-func-staging.azurewebsites.net

## Recent Changes (January 10, 2025)
- **deploy.bat Final Version**: Fully functional with authentication and clean output
- Fixed .env parsing to properly load Azure host keys
- Implemented clean output (suppressed JSON, shows only status codes)
- Added comprehensive testing for both staging and production slots
- Fixed all script execution issues (call prefix, timeout, authentication)
- Updated all endpoints to RESTful format (/api/sets/{setId}/cards/{cardId})
- Added 3-retry warm-up logic with proper health checks
- Created .github/workflows/deploy-function.yml for CI/CD pipeline

## Next Steps
1. Configure GitHub environment protection rules for production
2. Test the new deployment pipeline with a sample change
3. Consider adding automated integration tests
4. Monitor deployment metrics and adjust health check timings if needed

## Important Patterns
- **Staging First**: Never deploy directly to production except in emergencies
- **Test Before Swap**: Always verify staging works before swapping to production
- **Keep Rollback Ready**: Previous version stays in staging slot after swap
- **Health Checks**: Automated verification reduces risk of bad deployments

## Project Structure Notes
- Main repository: C:\Users\maber\Documents\GitHub\PokeData
- Function app: pokedata-func (with staging slot)
- Resource group: pokedata-rg
- Frontend: Deployed via separate GitHub Actions to Static Web App

## Configuration Requirements
- Both staging and production slots need same environment variables
- Mark slot-specific settings as "deployment slot settings" in Azure
- GitHub secrets already configured from previous setup
- **Function Keys in .env**:
  - `AZURE_FUNCTION_KEY_STAGING`: For staging slot authentication
  - `PRODUCTION_FUNCTION_KEY`: For production slot authentication
  - Both keys must be present in PokeDataFunc/.env for deploy.bat to work

## Testing Checklist
After staging deployment (fully automated in script):
1. Test GetSetList endpoint: `/api/sets` - Returns HTTP 200
2. Test GetCardsBySet with setId 557: `/api/sets/557/cards` - Returns HTTP 200
3. Test GetCardInfo with setId 557, cardId 73121: `/api/sets/557/cards/73121` - Returns HTTP 200
4. All tests show clean status codes only (no JSON payload clutter)
5. Manual URLs provided with authentication keys included

The deploy.bat script automatically runs all tests with proper authentication and clean output.

## Rollback Procedures
If issues after production deployment:
1. Quick: Swap slots back using deploy.bat option 3
2. Azure CLI: `az functionapp deployment slot swap`
3. Git: Revert commit and push to trigger new deployment

## Monitoring Points
- Response times on key endpoints
- Error rates in Application Insights
- Cold start frequency
- Memory usage patterns
- API credit consumption

## Development Workflow
1. Make changes locally
2. Test with local Azure Functions tools
3. Push to feature branch
4. Create PR to main (triggers validation)
5. Merge to main (auto-deploys to staging)
6. Test staging thoroughly
7. Approve production deployment in GitHub
8. Monitor production after swap

This new CI/CD pipeline significantly improves deployment safety and follows industry best practices for staged deployments with proper testing gates.
