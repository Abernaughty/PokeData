## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Repository Management**: Moved to a standalone repository for the PokeData project at `C:\Users\maber\Documents\GitHub\PokeData`.
   - Pros: Better isolation, focused development, clearer project boundaries, cleaner directory structure
   - Cons: Requires additional setup, potential duplication of common code
   - Decision: Maintain as a separate repository for cleaner project management
   - Note: The directory at `C:\Users\maber\Documents\GitHub\git-maber\PokeData` is a separate static web app workflow directory and should not be modified

2. **Dependency Management**: Continuing with current dependency versions for stability.
   - Pros: Ensures current functionality works reliably
   - Cons: Missing out on new features and security updates
   - Decision: Plan for incremental updates with careful testing

3. **Caching Strategy**: Using IndexedDB through the dbService for efficient offline caching.
   - Pros: Better performance than localStorage, supports larger data sets
   - Cons: More complex implementation, browser compatibility considerations
   - Decision: Continue with IndexedDB but add better error handling and fallbacks

4. **API Client Structure**: Using a centralized service with proxy support.
   - Pros: Consistent error handling, centralized caching, easier debugging
   - Cons: Potential bottleneck, more complex than direct fetch calls
   - Decision: Maintain the centralized approach but optimize for performance

5. **Component Architecture**: Using Svelte components with clear separation of concerns.
   - Pros: Maintainable, reusable, efficient updates
   - Cons: Requires careful state management
   - Decision: Continue with component-based architecture, improve documentation

### Design Considerations
1. **UI/UX Approach**:
   - Focus on simplicity and efficiency
   - Progressive disclosure of information
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Consistent feedback for user actions

2. **Visual Design**:
   - Pok√©mon-themed color palette (blue, red, white)
   - Clean, card-based layout
   - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
   - Accessible contrast and typography

### Technical Considerations
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Efficient API calls with caching
   - Lazy loading of images and data
   - Minimizing re-renders
   - Optimized search functionality

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful degradation
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - Comprehensive error logging

3. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Support for modern browsers
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Feature detection
   - Fallbacks for older browsers

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
1. **File Structure**:
   - Components in src/components/
   - Services in src/services/
   - Data utilities in src/data/
   - Main application in App.svelte
   - New expansionMapper service in src/services/

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - PascalCase for component files (SearchableSelect.svelte)
   - camelCase for JavaScript files (pokeDataService.js)
   - camelCase for functions and variables
   - Descriptive, action-oriented function names

3. **Component Structure**:
   ```

   ```

### Coding Patterns
1. **Service Pattern**:
   - Centralized services for data operations
   - Clear separation from UI components
   - Consistent error handling
   - Caching and optimization

2. **Component Composition**:
   - Small, focused components
   - Props for configuration
   - Events for communication
   - Slots for content projection

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Try/catch blocks for async operations
   - Fallback data when APIs fail
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Detailed console logging

4. **Caching Strategy**:
   - IndexedDB for persistent storage
   - Set-based caching for card data
   - TTL (Time To Live) for cache invalidation
   - Fallback to static data when cache fails

### Styling Approach
1. **CSS Organization**:
   - Component-scoped styles in Svelte
   - Global styles in public/global.css
   - Consistent color variables
   - Mobile-first responsive design

2. **Design Elements**:
   - Card-based UI components
   - Consistent spacing and typography
   - Pok√©mon-themed color palette
   - Clear visual hierarchy

## Learnings and Project Insights

We've gained several insights during the implementation:

1. **Expansion Grouping Value**: Organizing sets by expansion series significantly improves user navigation and reduces cognitive load when searching for specific sets.

2. **Repository Management**: Creating a standalone repository for the project improves focus and clarity but requires careful setup to ensure all dependencies and configurations are properly transferred.

2. **Dependency Management**: The project has several outdated dependencies, including major version updates (Svelte 3.x to 5.x). Updating these requires careful planning and incremental testing to avoid breaking changes.

3. **API Integration Challenges**: Working with external card pricing APIs presents challenges with inconsistent data formats, requiring robust parsing and normalization.

4. **Caching Complexity**: Effective caching requires careful consideration of cache invalidation, storage limits, and fallback mechanisms.

5. **Search UX Importance**: The two-step search process (set then card) significantly improves user experience compared to a single search field.

6. **Error Handling Significance**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages and fallbacks is crucial for maintaining a positive user experience.

7. **Performance Considerations**: Large datasets of card information require optimization techniques like pagination, filtering, and efficient rendering.

8. **Component Reusability**: Investing in reusable components like SearchableSelect pays dividends across the application.

9. **Variant Handling Complexity**: Pok√©mon cards often have multiple variants with different pricing, requiring special handling in the UI and data model.

10. **Offline Support Value**: Users appreciate the ability to access previously viewed data when offline or when APIs are unavailable.

11. **Feedback Importance**: Clear loading states, error messages, and success indicators significantly improve user confidence in the application.

12. **Data Normalization Necessity**: Different API responses require normalization to provide a consistent user experience.

13. **UI Organization Importance**: Hierarchical organization of data (like grouping sets by expansion) significantly improves usability for large datasets.

14. **Component Flexibility**: Designing components to handle both flat and hierarchical data structures (like SearchableSelect) provides greater reusability across the application.
