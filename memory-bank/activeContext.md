# Active Context

## Current Focus (January 10, 2025)
Successfully fixed CI/CD pipeline and completed comprehensive deployment system improvements.

### Latest Updates (Just Completed)
1. **Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Created comprehensive `test-api.js` for pre-deployment validation
   - Tests validate build output, configuration files, and function structure
   - Workflow now passes "Build and Test" step successfully
   - Deployment to staging in progress

2. **Pre-Deployment Testing Implementation**:
   - 14 validation tests covering all critical aspects
   - Checks TypeScript compilation, JSON validity, function registration
   - Validates data files and directory structure
   - Provides clear pass/fail feedback with colored output

3. **Deployment System Complete**:
   - Local deploy.bat fully functional with authentication
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline operational
   - Staging ‚Üí Production flow with manual approval gates
   - Clean output and comprehensive health checks

### Deploy.bat Improvements (Completed Earlier Today)
1. **Fixed .env File Parsing**:
   - Changed to `usebackq tokens=1,* delims==` for reliable parsing
   - Properly handles keys with special characters
   - Shows key prefix for verification (first 10 chars)
   - Script exits if staging key missing to prevent 401 errors

2. **Clean Output Implementation**:
   - All curl commands use `-o nul` to suppress JSON payloads
   - Only shows HTTP status codes for readability
   - Removed verbose debug messages after confirming functionality
   - Much cleaner deployment output for easier navigation

3. **Function Key Authentication Working**:
   - Successfully loads `AZURE_FUNCTION_KEY_STAGING` from .env
   - Successfully loads `PRODUCTION_FUNCTION_KEY` from .env
   - All endpoints properly authenticated with host keys
   - Manual test URLs include keys for browser testing

4. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Staging tests: `/api/sets`, `/api/sets/557/cards`, `/api/sets/557/cards/73121`
   - Production tests: Same endpoints with production key after swap
   - 3-retry warm-up logic with 30-second intervals
   - Clear success/failure indicators

### Script Execution Issues Fixed
- Added `call` prefix to all `func` and `az` commands to prevent premature exit
- Fixed timeout command (no more "input redirection not supported" errors)
- Corrected RESTful API endpoint URLs throughout script
- Authentication now working with proper host keys (not function keys)

### CI/CD Pipeline Status
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: New deploy-function.yml with proper staging/production separation
- **Build and Test**: ‚úÖ Passing with new test-api.js
- **Deploy to Staging**: üü° In progress (automatic)
- **Swap to Production**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Requires manual approval
- **Rollback Capability**: Previous version remains in staging for quick rollback

### Deployment Methods
1. **GitHub Actions** (Primary):
   - Push to main ‚Üí Auto-deploy to staging ‚Üí Manual approval ‚Üí Swap to production
   - PR validation runs tests without deployment
   - Now working with comprehensive pre-deployment tests
   
2. **Local deploy.bat** (Secondary - Fully Fixed):
   - Option 1: Safe deploy with staging‚Üítest‚Üíproduction flow (includes health checks and swap prompt)
   - Option 2: Emergency direct to production (bypass staging)
   - Option 3: Swap existing staging to production

### Key URLs
- Production: https://pokedata-func.azurewebsites.net
- Staging: https://pokedata-func-staging.azurewebsites.net
- GitHub Actions: https://github.com/Abernaughty/PokeData/actions

## Recent Changes (January 10, 2025)
- **test-api.js Created**: Comprehensive pre-deployment validation script
- **deploy.bat Final Version**: Fully functional with authentication and clean output
- Fixed .env parsing to properly load Azure host keys
- Implemented clean output (suppressed JSON, shows only status codes)
- Added comprehensive testing for both staging and production slots
- Fixed all script execution issues (call prefix, timeout, authentication)
- Updated all endpoints to RESTful format (/api/sets/{setId}/cards/{cardId})
- Added 3-retry warm-up logic with proper health checks
- Created .github/workflows/deploy-function.yml for CI/CD pipeline
- Created comprehensive documentation (cicd-deployment-guide.md, workflow-cleanup-analysis.md, workflow-final-validation.md)

## Next Steps
1. Monitor staging deployment completion
2. Test staging endpoints once deployment completes
3. Approve production deployment if staging tests pass
4. Configure GitHub environment protection rules for production
5. Consider adding automated integration tests

## Important Patterns
- **Staging First**: Never deploy directly to production except in emergencies
- **Test Before Swap**: Always verify staging works before swapping to production
- **Keep Rollback Ready**: Previous version stays in staging slot after swap
- **Health Checks**: Automated verification reduces risk of bad deployments
- **Pre-Deployment Validation**: Tests run before any deployment to catch issues early

## Project Structure Notes
- Main repository: C:\Users\maber\Documents\GitHub\PokeData
- Function app: pokedata-func (with staging slot)
- Resource group: pokedata-rg
- Frontend: Deployed via separate GitHub Actions to Static Web App

## Configuration Requirements
- Both staging and production slots need same environment variables
- Mark slot-specific settings as "deployment slot settings" in Azure
- GitHub secrets already configured from previous setup
- **Function Keys in .env**:
  - `AZURE_FUNCTION_KEY_STAGING`: For staging slot authentication
  - `PRODUCTION_FUNCTION_KEY`: For production slot authentication
  - Both keys must be present in PokeDataFunc/.env for deploy.bat to work

## Testing Checklist
After staging deployment (fully automated in script):
1. Test GetSetList endpoint: `/api/sets` - Returns HTTP 200
2. Test GetCardsBySet with setId 557: `/api/sets/557/cards` - Returns HTTP 200
3. Test GetCardInfo with setId 557, cardId 73121: `/api/sets/557/cards/73121` - Returns HTTP 200
4. All tests show clean status codes only (no JSON payload clutter)
5. Manual URLs provided with authentication keys included

The deploy.bat script automatically runs all tests with proper authentication and clean output.

## Rollback Procedures
If issues after production deployment:
1. Quick: Swap slots back using deploy.bat option 3
2. Azure CLI: `az functionapp deployment slot swap`
3. Git: Revert commit and push to trigger new deployment

## Monitoring Points
- Response times on key endpoints
- Error rates in Application Insights
- Cold start frequency
- Memory usage patterns
- API credit consumption

## Development Workflow
1. Make changes locally
2. Test with local Azure Functions tools
3. Push to feature branch
4. Create PR to main (triggers validation)
5. Merge to main (auto-deploys to staging)
6. Test staging thoroughly
7. Approve production deployment in GitHub
8. Monitor production after swap

This new CI/CD pipeline significantly improves deployment safety and follows industry best practices for staged deployments with proper testing gates. The addition of pre-deployment tests ensures code quality before any deployment occurs.
