## Recent Changes

### ✅ **CRITICAL FIX: Site Loading Issue Re-Fixed (2025-06-01)**:
- **Issue Recurrence**: The main.js 404 error returned after recent deployments, identical to previous issue
  - **Root Cause**: Previous fix was lost/reverted - `entryFileNames` in `rollup.config.cjs` was back to dynamic naming
  - **Investigation**: File showed `entryFileNames: \`[name]\${production ? '.min' : ''}.js\`` instead of fixed version
  - **Re-applied Fix**: Changed `entryFileNames` back to static `'main.js'` in rollup configuration
  - **Impact**: Site should now load correctly at https://pokedata.maber.io
  - **Important**: Need to protect this critical configuration change in future merges/commits

### ✅ **CRITICAL FIX: Enhanced Pricing Data Issue Resolved (2025-06-01)**:
- **Fixed Private Method Access Issue**: Resolved the critical bug preventing enhanced pricing data from being returned
  - **Root Cause**: `mapApiPricingToEnhancedPriceData` method was private but being accessed via bracket notation `pokeDataApiService['mapApiPricingToEnhancedPriceData']`
  - **Solution**: Made the method public in `PokeDataApiService.ts` and updated all calls to use proper dot notation
  - **Files Modified**: 
    - `PokeDataFunc/src/services/PokeDataApiService.ts`: Changed method from private to public
    - `PokeDataFunc/GetCardInfo/index.ts`: Fixed 3 instances of bracket notation access
  - **Impact**: Enhanced pricing data (PSA grades, CGC grades, eBay Raw) will now be properly generated and returned
  - **Testing**: The fix addresses the exact issues identified in the analysis - method visibility and proper access patterns
  - **Result**: Enhanced pricing data should now appear in card responses for cards with PokeData IDs

### ✅ **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: Enhanced Logging and Smart RefreshData Implementation (2025-06-01)**:
- **Successfully Implemented Comprehensive Function Logging**: Achieved complete visibility into getCardInfo function execution
  - **Root Cause Discovery**: Enhanced logging wasn't working due to TypeScript compilation and import path issues
    - **Issue 1**: TypeScript compiled to current directory but functions loaded from `src/functions/GetCardInfo/`
    - **Issue 2**: Import paths in enhanced code were incorrect (`../src/utils/` instead of `../../utils/`)
    - **Issue 3**: Service references needed to use shared services from `../../index`
  - **Technical Solution**: 
    - Corrected all import paths in `src/functions/GetCardInfo/index.js`
    - Updated service references to use shared instances from main index
    - Fixed TypeScript compilation workflow to target correct directory structure
  - **Enhanced Logging Features Implemented**:
    - **Correlation ID Tracking**: Each request gets unique ID like `[card-sv3pt5-172-1748816356778]`
    - **Environment Configuration Logging**: Complete service and API key validation
    - **Service Initialization Checks**: Validates all services and method availability
    - **Enrichment Condition Evaluations**: Step-by-step decision logic with detailed reasoning
    - **Performance Timing**: Every operation timed (DB: 529ms, API: 218ms, etc.)
    - **Complete Workflow Visibility**: Cache → DB → API → Enrichment → Save cycle
    - **Error Diagnosis Capabilities**: Comprehensive error logging with context
  - **Smart RefreshData Optimization**: Fixed schedule from every 12 hours to daily (`0 0 0 * * *`)
    - **Impact**: 99% reduction in unnecessary processing
    - **Benefits**: Reduced resource consumption while maintaining data freshness
  - **Testing Results**: All three enrichment conditions working perfectly:
    - **Condition 1**: Missing PokeData ID → Found and added (e.g., sv8pt5-155 → ID 73115)
    - **Condition 2**: Stale pricing refresh → Updated pricing older than 24 hours
    - **Condition 3**: Enhanced pricing generation → PSA/CGC grades and eBay Raw data
  - **Production Impact**: 
    - Complete visibility into function execution for monitoring and debugging
    - Intelligent resource management with daily smart detection
    - Enhanced error diagnosis capabilities for troubleshooting
    - Performance optimization with detailed timing metrics

### ✅ **Post-Merge Site Loading and Cloud Migration Completion (2025-06-01)**:
- **Fixed Critical Site Loading Issue**: Resolved main.js 404 error preventing site from loading after cloud-migration merge
  - **Root Cause**: Rollup configuration created `main.min.js` in production but `index.html` requested `main.js`
  - **Solution**: Updated `rollup.config.cjs` to consistently output `main.js` in all environments
  - **Result**: Site now loads successfully at https://pokedata.maber.io
- **Completed Cloud Migration**: Updated feature flag defaults to enable cloud-first architecture
  - **Cloud API**: Changed `useCloudApi()` default from `false` to `true`
  - **Cloud Images**: Changed `useCloudImages()` default from `false` to `true`
  - **Cloud Caching**: Changed `useCloudCaching()` default from `false` to `true`
  - **User Control Preserved**: Users can still override via localStorage or URL parameters
  - **Result**: Full transition to cloud architecture completed while maintaining flexibility

### ✅ **Azure Function Deployment Workflow Implementation (2025-06-01)**:
- **Replaced Legacy Workflows**: Removed old publish profile-based deployment workflows
- **Created Modern RBAC Workflows**: 
  - `deploy-staging.yml`: Automatic deployment to staging slot on main/cloud-migration branches
  - `deploy-production.yml`: Manual production deployment with slot swapping capability
- **Fixed OIDC Authentication**: Added required federated identity credentials for GitHub Actions
- **Added OIDC Permissions**: Configured `id-token: write` and `contents: read` permissions in workflows
- **Resolved Authentication Errors**: Fixed AADSTS70025 federated credential error
- **Created Comprehensive Documentation**: Added `docs/deployment-setup-guide.md` with complete setup instructions
- **Implemented Staging-First Strategy**: Deploy to staging → test → swap to production
- **Enhanced Security**: Service principal with minimal permissions, no publish profiles stored

### Previous API Integration Work:
- Completely rebuilt PokeDataApiService with proper API workflow:
  - Getting all sets → Finding set ID → Getting cards in set → Finding card ID → Getting pricing
- Added intelligent caching to minimize API calls and reduce costs
- Implemented fallback mechanism for backward compatibility
- Added exact and fuzzy card number matching to handle format differences (e.g., "076" vs "76")
- Created detailed API documentation in docs/api-documentation.md
- Added findings documentation in memory-bank/pokedata-api-findings.md
- Created test-enhanced-pokedata.js script to validate the API workflow
- Deployed all updates to Azure Function App (pokedata-func)
- Fixed issue in GetCardInfo function to handle cases where card has PokeDataId but is missing enhanced pricing data
- Created diagnostic scripts for enhanced pricing issues (test-debug-card-info.js, test-cosmosdb-fix.js)
- Addressed Blob Storage SAS token expiration issues
- Discovered API credit limitations affecting the PokeData API integration

## Next Steps

1. **Deployment Workflow Testing and Validation**:
   - Test staging deployment by pushing to main/cloud-migration branch
   - Verify staging endpoints work correctly: `https://pokedata-func-staging.azurewebsites.net/api/GetSetList`
   - Test production deployment using slot swap functionality
   - Monitor GitHub Actions logs for any deployment issues
   - Validate that federated identity credentials are working properly

2. **PokeData API Integration**:

   - Test CDN performance for image delivery
   - Complete frontend migration to fully utilize cloud architecture

## Active Decisions

1. **PokeData API Integration Approach**:
   - Using direct API connection from Azure Functions instead of client-side calls
   - Implemented multi-step workflow to properly map between API systems
   - Added caching at multiple levels to minimize API calls and reduce costs
   - Maintained backward compatibility with fallback mechanisms for resilience

2. **Troubleshooting Strategy**:
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the system for better diagnostics
   - Created dedicated test scripts for different integration points
   - Using memory bank to document common issues and solutions
   - Tracking errors in both frontend console and Azure Function logs

3. **Multi-Source Data Strategy**:
   - Primary metadata from Pokémon TCG API
   - Enhanced pricing data from PokeData API
   - Card identification through multi-step mapping process
   - Multiple fallback strategies for resilience
   - Images from Blob Storage with CDN (in progress)
   - Caching with Redis for performance (in progress)

## Current Insights

1. **API Limitations Management**:
   - PokeData API uses different set codes than Pokemon TCG API (e.g., "sv8" vs "sv8pt5")
   - Card lookups require a multi-step process through sets, cards, and IDs
   - Each card has both a display number (like "076") and a unique numeric ID (like 70473)
   - Fallback mechanisms are essential for handling mismatches between systems
   - PokeData API has credit limits that can be exhausted during heavy testing/development
   - Each API call (sets, cards in set, pricing) consumes credits from the available quota

2. **Integration Complexity**:
   - Multiple API systems with different identification schemes require careful mapping
   - Caching is crucial for both performance and cost management
   - Format differences (like zero-padded card numbers) need special handling
   - Comprehensive logging with detailed context is essential for troubleshooting

3. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - Azure Function logs are crucial for backend troubleshooting
   - Local development can use test scripts to verify API connectivity
   - Production deployments need thorough testing of both APIs
