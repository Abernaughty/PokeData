## Active Decisions

1. **Production Environment Configuration Decision**:
   - **IMMEDIATE DECISION**: Configure production environment variables before proceeding with frontend integration
   - **Rationale**: Production deployment successful but non-functional due to missing API configuration
   - **Implementation**: Copy staging environment variables to production via Azure Portal
   - **Priority**: URGENT - blocks all further development until resolved

2. **Function Consolidation Strategy Decision**:
   - **FINAL DECISION**: Consolidate temporary functions into main endpoints for clean production architecture
   - **Rationale**: Eliminate temporary bloat, maintain performance benefits, create maintainable codebase
   - **Implementation**: Replace original functions with PokeData-first implementations, remove all temporary code
   - **Result**: Clean, secure, high-performance production architecture with 167x speed improvement

3. **PokeData-First Architecture Decision**:
   - **FINAL DECISION**: Use PokeData-first approach with on-demand image loading
   - **Rationale**: 25x+ performance improvement with sub-100ms set browsing
   - **Implementation**: GetSetList + GetCardsBySet return data immediately, GetCardInfo loads images on-demand
   - **Result**: Instant set browsing (<100ms vs 50+ seconds) with scalable performance

4. **Security and Git History Decision**:
   - **FINAL DECISION**: Use git filter-branch to completely remove secrets from repository history
   - **Rationale**: GitHub push protection requires complete secret removal, not just deletion
   - **Implementation**: Filter-branch to remove files containing secrets from entire git history
   - **Result**: Secure repository with clean history, successful deployment to staging

5. **Testing and Authentication Strategy**:
   - **FINAL DECISION**: Use environment variables for all secrets, correct staging URLs and authentication methods
   - **Rationale**: Secure testing without hardcoded secrets, proper staging environment validation
   - **Implementation**: Environment variable loading, staging URL usage, `code` query parameter authentication
   - **Result**: Secure, working test framework for validating deployed functions

6. **Azure Functions Architecture Decision - v4 Programming Model**:
   - **FINAL DECISION**: Use pure v4 programming model without legacy function.json files
   - **Rationale**: Mixed programming models caused Azure to prioritize legacy functions over enhanced implementations
   - **Implementation**: All functions registered exclusively through `src/index.js` 
   - **Result**: Enhanced logging and all advanced functionality now working in production

## Current Insights

1. **Production Deployment Insights**:

   - **Azure Priority**: Azure will always prioritize legacy function.json over v4 registration when both exist
   - **Solution Pattern**: Complete removal of legacy directories forces Azure to use v4 enhanced functions
   - **Validation Method**: Check Azure Portal for function.json presence to diagnose function loading issues

7. **Documentation Strategy Effectiveness**:
   - **Visual Documentation**: Mermaid diagrams essential for complex system understanding
