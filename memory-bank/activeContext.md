## Learnings and Project Insights

We've gained several insights during the implementation and planning:

1. **Cloud Architecture Benefits**: Moving to a cloud-based architecture provides significant advantages in scalability, reliability, and feature capabilities compared to client-side only approaches.

2. **Hybrid API Value**: Leveraging multiple APIs allows us to combine the strengths of each, providing more comprehensive data and better user experience.

3. **Data Model Importance**: A well-designed data model is critical for supporting advanced features like graded card values and price history.

4. **Caching Strategy Complexity**: Effective caching requires a multi-tiered approach with different strategies for different data types and access patterns.

5. **Expansion Grouping Value**: Organizing sets by expansion series significantly improves user navigation and reduces cognitive load when searching for specific sets.

6. **Repository Management**: Creating a standalone repository for the project improves focus and clarity but requires careful setup to ensure all dependencies and configurations are properly transferred.

7. **Dependency Management**: The project has several outdated dependencies, including major version updates (Svelte 3.x to 5.x). Updating these requires careful planning and incremental testing to avoid breaking changes.

8. **API Integration Challenges**: Working with external card pricing APIs presents challenges with inconsistent data formats, requiring robust parsing and normalization.

9. **Search UX Importance**: The two-step search process (set then card) significantly improves user experience compared to a single search field.

10. **Error Handling Significance**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages and fallbacks is crucial for maintaining a positive user experience.

11. **Performance Considerations**: Large datasets of card information require optimization techniques like pagination, filtering, and efficient rendering.

12. **Component Reusability**: Investing in reusable components like SearchableSelect pays dividends across the application.

13. **Variant Handling Complexity**: Pok√©mon cards often have multiple variants with different pricing, requiring special handling in the UI and data model.

14. **Offline Support Value**: Users appreciate the ability to access previously viewed data when offline or when APIs are unavailable.

15. **Feedback Importance**: Clear loading states, error messages, and success indicators significantly improve user confidence in the application.

16. **Data Normalization Necessity**: Different API responses require normalization to provide a consistent user experience.

17. **UI Organization Importance**: Hierarchical organization of data (like grouping sets by expansion) significantly improves usability for large datasets.

18. **Component Flexibility**: Designing components to handle both flat and hierarchical data structures (like SearchableSelect) provides greater reusability across the application.

19. **Development Server Workflow**: The development server has specific behavior patterns that affect the workflow:
    - The server is configured to run on port 3000, which is whitelisted in the APIM configuration
    - The consolidated batch files (dev-server.bat and prod-server.bat) automatically detect and safely terminate any existing processes on port 3000
    - This ensures the server always runs on port 3000, which is required for API Management service integration
    - The robust process termination approach avoids conflicts and ensures clean server starts
    - When developing, use dev-server.bat which handles port conflicts automatically
    - Livereload functionality works correctly when using the proper development workflow

20. **Cost Management Importance**: Cloud services require careful cost management strategies, including serverless compute, tiered storage, and optimized caching to control operational expenses.

21. **Debug System Organization**: Organizing debug files into a modular structure with clear separation of concerns significantly improves maintainability and makes it easier to extend the debug system in the future.

22. **Development Session Cleanup**: When updating memory banks or completing development tasks:
    - Always remove temporary testing files (such as test scripts, temporary batch files)
    - Stop any running development servers before ending the session
    - Clean up any processes that might be lingering in the background
    - This prevents clutter, resource usage issues, and confusion in future sessions

23. **Azure Function Data Flow**: The Azure Function implementation follows a tiered data access pattern:
    - First checks Redis cache (if enabled and not forced to refresh)
    - If not in cache, checks Cosmos DB
    - If not in database, fetches from external API and populates both Cosmos DB and Redis
    - This provides optimal performance while maintaining data freshness

24. **On-Demand Database Population**: The system uses a "lazy loading" approach for card data:
    - Only stores data that users are actually requesting
    - Current sets (which are requested more frequently) are readily available
    - Older sets are fetched and stored when first requested
    - This optimizes storage resources while still providing good performance

25. **Set ID vs. Set Code Distinction**: There's an important distinction in the naming convention:
    - Set ID: The internal identifier used by the Pok√©mon TCG API (e.g., "sv8")
    - Set Code: The code used in the Pok√©mon TCG Online game (e.g., "PAL")
    - The API endpoints expect the Set Code, not the Set ID
    - This distinction needs to be clearly handled in the frontend migration

26. **Phased Migration Benefits**: The incremental migration approach provides several advantages:
    - Allows for testing at each step
    - Reduces risk with smaller, manageable changes
    - Provides opportunity for rollback if issues arise
    - Enables validation of each component before moving to the next
