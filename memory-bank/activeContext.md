# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Completed robust implementation of PokeData API integration with proper workflow
- Added comprehensive API documentation for both Pokemon TCG API and PokeData API 
- Resolved set code and card ID mapping issues between different API systems
- Deployed updates to Azure Functions app
- Investigating and fixing issues with enhanced pricing data retrieval

## Recent Changes
- Completely rebuilt PokeDataApiService with proper API workflow:
  - Getting all sets → Finding set ID → Getting cards in set → Finding card ID → Getting pricing
- Added intelligent caching to minimize API calls and reduce costs
- Implemented fallback mechanism for backward compatibility
- Added exact and fuzzy card number matching to handle format differences (e.g., "076" vs "76")
- Created detailed API documentation in docs/api-documentation.md
- Added findings documentation in memory-bank/pokedata-api-findings.md
- Created test-enhanced-pokedata.js script to validate the API workflow
- Deployed all updates to Azure Function App (pokedata-func)
- Fixed issue in GetCardInfo function to handle cases where card has PokeDataId but is missing enhanced pricing data
- Created diagnostic scripts for enhanced pricing issues (test-debug-card-info.js, test-cosmosdb-fix.js)
- Addressed Blob Storage SAS token expiration issues
- Discovered API credit limitations affecting the PokeData API integration

## Next Steps
1. **PokeData API Integration**:
   - Acquire additional PokeData API credits to continue development and testing
   - Implement rate limiting in batch operations to avoid quickly depleting API credits
   - Add a "credits remaining" check before making API calls when possible
   - Monitor logs in Azure portal to verify proper API calls
   - Implement set code mapping table to improve matching between different API systems
   - Consider adding additional fallback strategies for card identification
   - Enhanced error handling and notification when pricing data might be incorrect

2. **Feature Flag UI Improvements**:
   - Consider enhancing feature flag UI in debug panel
   - Add visual indicator when cloud API is being used
   - Consider permanent toggle in UI for cloud/local data source

3. **Cloud Architecture Implementation**:
   - Continue Redis Cache configuration
   - Update Blob Storage connectivity with refreshed credentials
   - Test CDN performance for image delivery
   - Complete frontend migration to fully utilize cloud architecture

## Active Decisions

1. **PokeData API Integration Approach**:
   - Using direct API connection from Azure Functions instead of client-side calls
   - Implemented multi-step workflow to properly map between API systems
   - Added caching at multiple levels to minimize API calls and reduce costs
   - Maintained backward compatibility with fallback mechanisms for resilience

2. **Troubleshooting Strategy**:
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the system for better diagnostics
   - Created dedicated test scripts for different integration points
   - Using memory bank to document common issues and solutions
   - Tracking errors in both frontend console and Azure Function logs

3. **Multi-Source Data Strategy**:
   - Primary metadata from Pokémon TCG API
   - Enhanced pricing data from PokeData API
   - Card identification through multi-step mapping process
   - Multiple fallback strategies for resilience
   - Images from Blob Storage with CDN (in progress)
   - Caching with Redis for performance (in progress)

## Current Insights

1. **API Limitations Management**:
   - PokeData API uses different set codes than Pokemon TCG API (e.g., "sv8" vs "sv8pt5")
   - Card lookups require a multi-step process through sets, cards, and IDs
   - Each card has both a display number (like "076") and a unique numeric ID (like 70473)
   - Fallback mechanisms are essential for handling mismatches between systems
   - PokeData API has credit limits that can be exhausted during heavy testing/development
   - Each API call (sets, cards in set, pricing) consumes credits from the available quota

2. **Integration Complexity**:
   - Multiple API systems with different identification schemes require careful mapping
   - Caching is crucial for both performance and cost management
   - Format differences (like zero-padded card numbers) need special handling
   - Comprehensive logging with detailed context is essential for troubleshooting

3. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - Azure Function logs are crucial for backend troubleshooting
   - Local development can use test scripts to verify API connectivity
   - Production deployments need thorough testing of both APIs
