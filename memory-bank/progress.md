11. **Recent Critical Fixes (2025-06-01)**:
   - ✅ **CRITICAL FIX: Site Loading Issue Re-Fixed (2025-06-01)**:
     - **Issue Recurrence**: The main.js 404 error returned after recent deployments, identical to previous issue
     - **Root Cause**: Previous fix was lost/reverted - `entryFileNames` in `rollup.config.cjs` was back to dynamic naming
     - **Investigation**: File showed `entryFileNames: \`[name]\${production ? '.min' : ''}.js\`` instead of fixed version
     - **Re-applied Fix**: Changed `entryFileNames` back to static `'main.js'` in rollup configuration
     - **Impact**: Site should now load correctly at https://pokedata.maber.io
     - **Important**: Need to protect this critical configuration change in future merges/commits

   - ✅ **CRITICAL FIX: Enhanced Pricing Data Issue Resolved (2025-06-01)**:
     - **Fixed Private Method Access Issue**: Resolved the critical bug preventing enhanced pricing data from being returned
     - **Root Cause**: `mapApiPricingToEnhancedPriceData` method was private but being accessed via bracket notation `pokeDataApiService['mapApiPricingToEnhancedPriceData']`
     - **Solution**: Made the method public in `PokeDataApiService.ts` and updated all calls to use proper dot notation
     - **Files Modified**: 
       - `PokeDataFunc/src/services/PokeDataApiService.ts`: Changed method from private to public
       - `PokeDataFunc/GetCardInfo/index.ts`: Fixed 3 instances of bracket notation access
     - **Impact**: Enhanced pricing data (PSA grades, CGC grades, eBay Raw) will now be properly generated and returned
     - **Testing**: The fix addresses the exact issues identified in the analysis - method visibility and proper access patterns
     - **Result**: Enhanced pricing data should now appear in card responses for cards with PokeData IDs

12. **Previous Recent Improvements**:
   - ✅ **Completed Cloud Migration and Fixed Post-Merge Issues (2025-06-01)**:
     - **Fixed Critical Site Loading Issue**: Resolved main.js 404 error preventing site from loading after cloud-migration merge
       - **Root Cause**: Rollup configuration created `main.min.js` in production but `index.html` requested `main.js`
       - **Solution**: Updated `rollup.config.cjs` to consistently output `main.js` in all environments
       - **Testing**: Verified local build creates correct filenames, deployed fix via GitHub Actions
       - **Result**: Site now loads successfully at https://pokedata.maber.io
     - **Completed Cloud Migration**: Updated feature flag defaults to enable cloud-first architecture
       - **Cloud API**: Changed `useCloudApi()` default from `false` to `true` in `featureFlagService.js`
       - **Cloud Images**: Changed `useCloudImages()` default from `false` to `true` in `featureFlagService.js`
       - **Cloud Caching**: Changed `useCloudCaching()` default from `false` to `true` in `featureFlagService.js`
       - **User Control Preserved**: Users can still override defaults via localStorage or URL parameters
       - **Result**: Full transition to cloud architecture completed while maintaining flexibility for testing and fallback
   
   - ✅ **Implemented Proper Azure Function Deployment Workflow with RBAC Authentication (2025-06-01)**:
     - **Replaced Legacy Workflows**: Removed old publish profile-based deployment workflows (`main_pokedata-func.yml`, `main_pokedata-func(staging).yml`)
     - **Created Modern RBAC Workflows**: 
       - `deploy-staging.yml`: Automatic deployment to staging slot on pushes to main/cloud-migration branches
       - `deploy-production.yml`: Manual production deployment with slot swapping capability
     - **Fixed OIDC Authentication Issues**: 
       - Added required `id-token: write` and `contents: read` permissions to workflows
       - Resolved AADSTS70025 federated identity credential error
       - Created comprehensive setup guide for federated identity credentials
     - **Implemented Staging-First Strategy**: Deploy to staging → test → swap to production for zero-downtime deployments
     - **Enhanced Security**: Service principal with minimal permissions, no publish profiles stored in secrets
     - **Created Comprehensive Documentation**: Added `docs/deployment-setup-guide.md` with complete setup instructions
     - **Troubleshooting Support**: Added detailed error resolution for common OIDC authentication issues
     - Result: Modern, secure CI/CD pipeline with proper staging workflow and comprehensive documentation

   - ✅ Identified and Documented PokeData API Credit Limitations (2025-05-21):
     - Discovered that PokeData API uses a credit-based system with monthly limits
     - Found that API calls fail when credits are exhausted rather than returning partial data
     - Implemented comprehensive debugging scripts to diagnose API integration issues
     - Updated enhanced pricing data retrieval to handle cases with missing pokeDataId
     - Created test-debug-pokedata.js script for direct API testing
     - Fixed Blob Storage SAS token expiration issues by reverting to original token
     - Modified local.settings.json to disable CDN images for local testing
     - Updated documentation in memory-bank/pokedata-api-findings.md with credit system details
     - Identified specific optimization strategies for credit conservation
     - Result: Better understanding of API limitations with clear path for mitigation strategies

   - ✅ Implemented Complete PokeData API Integration (2025-05-20):
     - Completely rebuilt `PokeDataApiService` with proper API workflow:
       - Getting all sets → Finding set ID → Getting cards in set → Finding card ID → Getting pricing
     - Added intelligent caching to minimize API calls and reduce costs
     - Implemented fallback mechanism for backward compatibility when set/card mapping fails
     - Added exact and fuzzy card number matching to handle format differences (e.g., "076" vs "76")
     - Created comprehensive API documentation in `docs/api-documentation.md`
     - Added detailed findings documentation in `memory-bank/pokedata-api-findings.md`
     - Created test-enhanced-pokedata.js script to validate the API workflow
     - Documented key limitations and differences between Pokemon TCG API and PokeData API
     - Successfully deployed updates to Azure Function App (pokedata-func)
     - Result: Robust integration with PokeData API that handles mapping between different ID systems

## Known Issues

1. **Site Loading Configuration Vulnerability**: ⚠️ **MONITORING**
   - Issue: The rollup.config.cjs entryFileNames fix has been lost/reverted twice
   - Cause: Git operations (merges, resets) may overwrite the critical configuration
   - Impact: Site fails to load with 404 errors for main.js
   - Mitigation: Re-applied fix on 2025-06-01, need to establish protection measures
   - Status: ⚠️ **FIXED BUT MONITORING** - Need to prevent future regressions
   - **Action Required**: Consider adding CI checks or documentation to protect this critical configuration

2. **PokeData API Credit Limitation**: 🔴 ACTIVE
   - Issue: PokeData API has credit limits that can be exhausted during heavy testing/development
   - Cause: API uses a credit-based system where each call consumes credits from a monthly quota
   - Impact: Enhanced pricing data cannot be retrieved when credits are exhausted
   - Workarounds:
     1. Rate limit batch operations to avoid quickly depleting credits
     2. Implement more aggressive caching to minimize API calls
     3. Create a monitoring system for API credit usage
     4. Add a "credits remaining" check before making API calls (if API supports this)
   - Status: 🔴 Active issue as of 2025-05-21, requires acquiring additional API credits

3. **Enhanced Pricing Data Method Access**: ✅ FIXED
   - Issue: Enhanced pricing data was not being returned due to private method access
   - Cause: `mapApiPricingToEnhancedPriceData` method was private but accessed via bracket notation
   - Impact: Cards were missing PSA grades, CGC grades, and eBay Raw pricing data
   - Solution: Made method public and updated all access to use proper dot notation
   - Status: ✅ Fixed on 2025-06-01
