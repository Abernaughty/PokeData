   - Workaround: Adapter pattern implementation with multiple format checks
   - Status: ðŸŸ¡ Partially addressed with adapter pattern

4. **Slow Initial Load Time**:
   - Issue: First load of the application can be slow
   - Cause: Multiple API requests and lack of code splitting
   - Impact: Poor first-time user experience
   - Workaround: Caching helps on subsequent visits
   - Status: ðŸ”´ Pending optimization

5. **Limited Offline Support**:
   - Issue: Some features don't work well offline

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Concept
The project began as a simple tool to check PokÃ©mon card prices from a single source. The initial concept focused on:

- Basic search functionality
- Single pricing source
- Minimal UI
- No offline support

### Architecture Evolution
As the project progressed, the architecture evolved to address more complex requirements:

1. **Repository Management**:
   - Initial Approach: Part of a multi-project repository at `C:\Users\maber\Documents\GitHub\git-maber\PokeData-repo`
     - Pros: Shared infrastructure, easier cross-project references
     - Cons: Less isolation, potential conflicts with other projects
   - Current Approach: Standalone repository at `C:\Users\maber\Documents\GitHub\PokeData`
     - Pros: Better isolation, focused development, clearer project boundaries, cleaner directory structure
     - Cons: Requires additional setup, potential duplication of common code
   - Note: The directory at `C:\Users\maber\Documents\GitHub\git-maber\PokeData` is a separate static web app workflow directory that should not be modified
   - Rationale: Cleaner project management and better focus on PokeData-specific features

2. **Data Retrieval Approach**:
   - Initial Approach: Direct API calls without caching
     - Pros: Simpler implementation
     - Cons: Repeated API calls, no offline support
   - Current Approach: API calls with IndexedDB caching
     - Pros: Reduced API calls, offline support
     - Cons: More complex implementation
   - Rationale: Better user experience and reduced API usage

3. **Search Interface**:
   - Initial Approach: Single search field for all cards
     - Pros: Simpler UI
     - Cons: Inefficient for large datasets
   - Current Approach: Two-step search (set then card)
     - Pros: More efficient search, better organization
     - Cons: Additional step in the process
   - Rationale: Improved usability with large card database

4. **Component Architecture**:
   - Initial Approach: Monolithic components
     - Pros: Easier initial development
     - Cons: Limited reusability, harder to maintain
   - Current Approach: Reusable component library
     - Pros: Better maintainability, consistent UI
     - Cons: More upfront development time
   - Rationale: Long-term maintainability and consistency

### Feature Prioritization Evolution
Feature priorities evolved based on user feedback and development insights:

1. **Initial Priority**: Basic search and price display
2. **Current Priority**: Repository migration, dependency updates, and error handling improvements
3. **Future Priority**: Visual enhancements, collection management, and advanced features
4. **Rationale**: Focus on core functionality and technical foundation first, then enhance user experience

### Technical Approach Evolution
The technical implementation approach has also evolved:

1. **API Authentication Approach**:

     - Cons: More complex setup, requires .env file management
   - Current Approach: Hardcoded subscription key with API Management service handling authentication
     - Pros: Simplified development workflow, no environment variables to manage
     - Cons: Less flexibility for different environments
   - Rationale: Security is maintained through API Management restrictions (origin limitations, rate limits) while simplifying the development process

2. **Storage Strategy**:
   - Initial Approach: localStorage for simple caching
     - Pros: Simple API, easy implementation
     - Cons: Limited storage space, string-only storage
   - Current Approach: IndexedDB for robust storage
     - Pros: Larger storage capacity, structured data
     - Cons: More complex API
   - Rationale: Need for more robust storage solution

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Initial Approach: Basic try/catch blocks
     - Pros: Simple implementation
     - Cons: Limited error information for users
   - Current Approach: Comprehensive error handling with fallbacks
     - Pros: Better user experience, more resilient application
     - Cons: More complex code
   - Rationale: Improved reliability and user experience

3. **UI Implementation**:
   - Initial Approach: Basic HTML forms
