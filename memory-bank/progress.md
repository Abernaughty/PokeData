## Known Issues

1. **PokeData API Credit Limitation**: 🔴 ACTIVE
   - Issue: PokeData API has credit limits that can be exhausted during heavy testing/development
   - Cause: API uses a credit-based system where each call consumes credits from a monthly quota
   - Impact: Enhanced pricing data cannot be retrieved when credits are exhausted
   - Workarounds:
     1. Rate limit batch operations to avoid quickly depleting credits
     2. Implement more aggressive caching to minimize API calls
     3. Create a monitoring system for API credit usage
     4. Add a "credits remaining" check before making API calls (if API supports this)
   - Status: 🔴 Active issue as of 2025-05-21, requires acquiring additional API credits

2. **Azure Function Pagination Limitation**: ✅ FIXED
   - Issue: Azure Function GetCardsBySet only returned 100 cards even for sets with more cards
   - Cause: Default pageSize parameter in the GetCardsBySet function was set to 100 cards
   - Impact: Users couldn't search for cards beyond the first 100 in large sets
   - Solution: Increased default pageSize to 500 and fixed PokemonTcgApiService to handle API pagination
   - Status: ✅ Fixed on 2025-05-20

2. **Incomplete Card Set Results in cloudDataService**: ✅ FIXED
   - Issue: Only the first 100 cards were being retrieved for sets with more than 100 cards
   - Cause: Limited pagination in cloudDataService.js that didn't fetch all pages
   - Impact: Users couldn't access all cards in larger sets
   - Solution: Implemented complete pagination in cloudDataService.js with automatic page fetching
   - Status: ✅ Fixed on 2025-05-20

3. **Expansion Grouping Format Mismatch**: ✅ FIXED
   - Issue: Expansion headers in dropdown only showed the expansion name again instead of the actual sets
   - Cause: Format mismatch between backend and frontend for grouped sets
     - Backend format: `[{type: 'group', name: 'X', items: [...]}, ...]`
     - Frontend expected format: `{'X': [...], 'Y': [...], ...}`
   - Impact: Poor user experience with unusable expansion grouping in dropdown
   - Solution: Added transformation logic in cloudDataService.getSetList() to convert between formats
   - Status: ✅ Fixed on 2025-05-14

4. **Set ID vs. Set Code API Parameter Issue**: ✅ FIXED
   - Issue: API endpoints expect Set Code (e.g., "OBF") but were being queried with Set ID (e.g., "sv8")
   - Cause: Confusion between the two different identifiers used in the Pokémon TCG system
   - Impact: "No results" errors when querying for sets using the wrong identifier
   - Solution: Clarified the difference between identifiers
