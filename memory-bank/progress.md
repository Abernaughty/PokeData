# Progress

## Overview
This document tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions for the PokeData project.

## What Works

The PokeData project has achieved a mature cloud-first architecture with comprehensive functionality and enterprise-grade project organization:

### ✅ **AZURE FUNCTIONS DEPLOYMENT ISSUE RESOLUTION (2025-09-16 - 4:30 PM)**:
- **🔍 INVESTIGATION COMPLETE**: Successfully identified and resolved Azure Functions deployment issues after npm→pnpm migration
  - **Problem Identified**: Azure Functions no longer visible in portal after switching to pnpm
  - **Investigation Method**: Used GitHub MCP Server to access workflow deployment logs
  - **Root Cause Discovered**: Azure Functions v4 programming model fundamentally incompatible with pnpm's symlink-based node_modules structure
  
  - **Resolution Strategy**: Complete reversion from pnpm back to npm
    - **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Reverted pnpm setup back to npm configuration
    - **Package Configuration**: Updated .funcignore to exclude package-lock.json instead of pnpm-lock.yaml
    - **Dependency Cleanup**: Removed pnpm-lock.yaml files from both root and PokeDataFunc directories
    - **Build Environment**: Cleaned and rebuilt with npm to ensure proper dependency resolution
    - **Secondary Issue Fix**: Resolved GitHub Actions npm caching by force-adding required package-lock.json
  
  - **Technical Findings**:
    - **Symlink Incompatibility**: pnpm's symlink structure prevents Azure Functions runtime from discovering functions
    - **False Positive Deployments**: GitHub Actions can report successful deployments while Azure Functions fail to register
    - **Platform Limitation**: No configuration workaround available - this is a fundamental incompatibility
    - **Package Manager Sensitivity**: Serverless platforms have specific requirements for dependency structure
  
  - **Deployment Status**: ✅ Successfully reverted to npm, functions now visible in Azure portal and fully operational
  - **Documentation Updated**: Memory bank updated with compatibility constraints and lessons learned

### ✅ **.GITIGNORE CLEANUP AND PROJECT STRUCTURE CLARIFICATION (2025-01-12 - 3:00 PM)**:
- **🧹 .GITIGNORE FILE MAINTENANCE**: Cleaned up irrelevant entries for focused project configuration
  - **Removed Entries**:
    - All Python-related patterns (20+ lines) - project is JavaScript/TypeScript only
    - Non-existent batch files (init-git.bat, stage-and-commit.bat, push-to-github.bat)
  - **Improvements Made**:
    - Better organization with clearer section headers
    - Added `.vscode/`, `desktop.ini`, `*.orig` files to ignored patterns
    - Added temp directories (`.temp/`, `.tmp/`)
    - Consolidated log file patterns
  - **Clarifications Documented**:
    - `PokeDataFunc/dist/` correctly ignored (TypeScript compilation output)
    - `PokeDataFunc/data/` files are source data and should be tracked
    - Monorepo structure confirmed as correct (frontend at root, backend in subdirectory)

### ✅ **ROOT DIRECTORY REORGANIZATION (2025-01-12 - 2:44 PM)**:
- **📁 PROJECT STRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS**: Organized scripts following best practices
  - **Scripts Directory Created**: Moved all build/utility scripts to `scripts/` folder
    - `build-app.bat` → `scripts/build-app.bat`
    - `build.js` → `scripts/build.js`
    - `deploy-frontend.js` → `scripts/deploy-frontend.js`
    - `server.bat` → `scripts/server.bat`
    - `tools.bat` → `scripts/tools.bat`
  - **Documentation Updates**:
    - Created `scripts/README.md` with comprehensive script documentation
    - Updated main `README.md` with new script paths
    - Updated `package.json` script references
  - **Benefits Achieved**:
    - Cleaner root directory (reduced from 15 to 10 files)
    - Better organization with related scripts grouped together
    - Follows common JavaScript/Node.js project best practices

### ✅ **SCRIPT CONSOLIDATION AND DEPLOYMENT DOCUMENTATION (2025-01-12 - Late Afternoon)**:
- **📦 POKEDATAFUNC SCRIPTS CONSOLIDATION**: Reduced 9 redundant scripts to 3 multi-purpose tools
  - **Consolidated Scripts Created**:
    - `set-mapping.js`: All set mapping operations (--analyze, --generate, --manual)
    - `manage-image-urls.js`: All image URL management (--fix, --all, --set=ID)
    - `test-image-urls.js`: All testing and verification (--simple, --with-db, --test-fix, --verify)
  - **Scripts Removed**: 9 redundant scripts eliminated
    - analyze-ptcgo-mapping.js, generate-set-mapping.js, generate-optimized-set-mapping.js
    - update-image-urls.js, fix-image-urls.js
    - test-image-url-update.js, test-image-url-simple.js, test-url-fix.js, verify-optimization.js
  - **Documentation Created**:
    - `PokeDataFunc/scripts/README.md`: Comprehensive usage guide with workflows and troubleshooting
    - Migration notes for transitioning from old scripts to new consolidated versions

- **📚 COMPREHENSIVE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE**: Created unified deployment documentation
  - **New File**: `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` at project root
  - **Clear Environment Distinction**:
    - Local Development: Scripts that run locally only
    - Production Deployment: CI/CD via GitHub Actions (primary) with manual backup options
    - Data Management: Scripts that run locally but connect to production DB
  - **Deployment Methods Documented**:
    - Frontend: GitHub Actions → Azure Static Web Apps (automatic on push to main)
    - Backend: GitHub Actions → Azure Functions (automatic on push to main)
    - Database/Cache: Managed Azure services (no deployment needed)
  - **Key Clarifications**:
    - Data management scripts run locally but modify production database
    - Manual deployment scripts are backup methods only
    - CI/CD is the preferred deployment method for both frontend and backend

### ✅ **BUILD AND DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT CONSOLIDATION (2025-01-12 - Afternoon)**:
- **🧹 PROJECT CLEANUP**: Removed 7 redundant files for cleaner structure
  - **Files Removed**:

    - `deploy-to-production.bat`, `run-app.bat` - Obsolete scripts
    - `dev-server.bat`, `prod-server.bat` - Replaced by unified script
  - **Unified Server Script**: Created `server.bat` with parameter support
    - Usage: `server.bat` (defaults to dev), `server.bat dev`, `server.bat prod`
    - Includes automatic build check for production mode
  - **Package.json Cleanup**: Removed redundant and duplicate scripts
