# Progress

## Overview
This document tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions for the PokeData project.

## What Works

The PokeData project has achieved a mature cloud-first architecture with comprehensive functionality and enterprise-grade project organization:

### ‚úÖ **.GITIGNORE CLEANUP AND PROJECT STRUCTURE CLARIFICATION (2025-01-12 - 3:00 PM)**:
- **üßπ .GITIGNORE FILE MAINTENANCE**: Cleaned up irrelevant entries for focused project configuration
  - **Removed Entries**:
    - All Python-related patterns (20+ lines) - project is JavaScript/TypeScript only
    - Non-existent batch files (init-git.bat, stage-and-commit.bat, push-to-github.bat)
  - **Improvements Made**:
    - Better organization with clearer section headers
    - Added `.vscode/`, `desktop.ini`, `*.orig` files to ignored patterns
    - Added temp directories (`.temp/`, `.tmp/`)
    - Consolidated log file patterns
  - **Clarifications Documented**:
    - `PokeDataFunc/dist/` correctly ignored (TypeScript compilation output)
    - `PokeDataFunc/data/` files are source data and should be tracked
    - Monorepo structure confirmed as correct (frontend at root, backend in subdirectory)

### ‚úÖ **ROOT DIRECTORY REORGANIZATION (2025-01-12 - 2:44 PM)**:
- **üìÅ PROJECT STRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS**: Organized scripts following best practices
  - **Scripts Directory Created**: Moved all build/utility scripts to `scripts/` folder
    - `build-app.bat` ‚Üí `scripts/build-app.bat`
    - `build.js` ‚Üí `scripts/build.js`
    - `deploy-frontend.js` ‚Üí `scripts/deploy-frontend.js`
    - `server.bat` ‚Üí `scripts/server.bat`
    - `tools.bat` ‚Üí `scripts/tools.bat`
  - **Documentation Updates**:
    - Created `scripts/README.md` with comprehensive script documentation
    - Updated main `README.md` with new script paths
    - Updated `package.json` script references
  - **Benefits Achieved**:
    - Cleaner root directory (reduced from 15 to 10 files)
    - Better organization with related scripts grouped together
    - Follows common JavaScript/Node.js project best practices

### ‚úÖ **SCRIPT CONSOLIDATION AND DEPLOYMENT DOCUMENTATION (2025-01-12 - Late Afternoon)**:
- **üì¶ POKEDATAFUNC SCRIPTS CONSOLIDATION**: Reduced 9 redundant scripts to 3 multi-purpose tools

    - `test-image-urls.js`: All testing and verification (--simple, --with-db, --test-fix, --verify)
  - **Scripts Removed**: 9 redundant scripts eliminated
    - analyze-ptcgo-mapping.js, generate-set-mapping.js, generate-optimized-set-mapping.js
    - update-image-urls.js, fix-image-urls.js
    - test-image-url-update.js, test-image-url-simple.js, test-url-fix.js, verify-optimization.js
  - **Documentation Created**:
    - `PokeDataFunc/scripts/README.md`: Comprehensive usage guide with workflows and troubleshooting

  - **Key Clarifications**:
    - Data management scripts run locally but modify production database
    - Manual deployment scripts are backup methods only
    - CI/CD is the preferred deployment method for both frontend and backend
