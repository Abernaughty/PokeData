## Overview
This document tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions for the PokeData project.

## What Works

The current state of the PokeData project includes the following working features:

### ✅ **🎉 Azure Static Web Apps Deployment Crisis Resolved (2025-06-04)**:
- **🚀 MAJOR DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS**: Successfully resolved critical deployment failures and created new working Static Web App
  - **Root Cause Identified**: Mixed configuration state from previous workflow cleanup caused invalid deployment token
    - **Problem**: Old deployment token (ending in `01008040579a9c10`) was permanently linked to deleted workflow file (`azure-static-web-apps-orange-ocean-0579a9c10.yml`)
    - **Azure Behavior**: Static Web Apps creates permanent binding between deployment token and specific workflow file name
    - **Impact**: Even refreshing token didn't fix underlying configuration mismatch between expected and actual workflow files
  - **Solution Implemented**: Created new Static Web App with clean configuration
    - **✅ New Resource**: `Pokedata-SWA` created with hostname `calm-mud-07a7f7a10.6.azurestaticapps.net`
    - **✅ Clean Configuration**: Fresh GitHub integration with proper workflow file (`azure-static-web-apps-calm-mud-07a7f7a10.yml`)
    - **✅ Valid Deployment Token**: New token properly linked to current workflow configuration
    - **✅ Automatic Workflow Creation**: Azure automatically generated working workflow file with valid API token
    - **✅ CORS Configuration**: Added new Static Web App origin to Azure Functions CORS settings for API access
  - **Systematic Debugging Process**:
    - **✅ Azure CLI Investigation**: Used `az staticwebapp show` to identify mixed configuration state
    - **✅ Token Validation**: Used curl to confirm old token was invalid (`InvalidAuthenticationToken`)
    - **✅ Disconnect/Reconnect Attempt**: Tried Azure CLI disconnect/reconnect but configuration remained mixed
    - **✅ Filename Test**: Renamed workflow to old expected name to verify Azure's workflow file binding behavior
    - **✅ Clean Slate Solution**: Created new resource when configuration repair proved unreliable
  - **Technical Insights Gained**:
