# Comprehensive Code Review for PokeData Project (Pokémon Card Price Checker)

I need a thorough review of my Svelte-based PokeData project (Pokémon Card Price Checker) to identify issues and improvements. This web application allows users to search for Pokémon cards by set name and card name, providing pricing information from multiple sources. Please analyze the JavaScript, Svelte, HTML, CSS, and batch files in the project with these focus areas:

## 1. Project Structure & File Organization
- Identify redundant or unnecessary files, particularly batch files (*.bat) that may serve duplicate purposes
- Flag orphaned files that aren't referenced anywhere, especially debug files like those in src/ (debug-*.js)
- Check for inconsistent file naming patterns across components, services, and utility functions
- Identify files that may serve overlapping purposes or duplicate functionality
- Evaluate if the organization of components/, services/, and data/ directories follows best practices
- Look for misplaced files that should be in a different directory based on their purpose
- Assess if any mock data in public/mock/ should be removed from production

## 2. Code Quality Issues
- Locate code duplications across components and services
- Identify overly complex functions or Svelte components that could be simplified or broken down
- Flag inconsistent coding styles between JavaScript and Svelte files
- Find unused functions, methods, variables, imports, or dependencies in the codebase
- Detect leftover testing code, debug statements, console.logs, or commented-out code blocks
- Check for hardcoded values that should be moved to configuration files
- Identify any debug-related code (debug-*.js files) that should be removed or disabled in production
- Flag any patterns that don't follow Svelte best practices
- Look for inefficient Svelte reactivity patterns or unnecessary re-renders

## 3. Architecture & Design
- Evaluate Svelte component separation of concerns and organization

Present the review in a structured format with the most critical issues highlighted first. Focus particularly on identifying any leftover development/debugging files, duplicate approaches to functionality, and inconsistencies that may have been introduced while working with AI across multiple sessions.

For each category, rank issues by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and provide clear, actionable recommendations. Where appropriate, include code snippets illustrating both the problematic code and the recommended solution.

Example format:
```
## Category: [Name]

### 1. [Issue Title] - [Severity]
- **Location**: [File/Function/Line]
- **Description**: [Clear explanation of the issue]
- **Impact**: [How this affects the application]
- **Recommendation**: [Specific suggestion for fixing]
- **Example**:

Current:
```javascript
// Problematic code
```

Recommended:
```javascript
// Improved code
```
```

This comprehensive review will help identify technical debt, improve code quality, and ensure the project adheres to modern development standards while eliminating inconsistencies from cross-session AI development.

## Integration with Development Workflow

This code review process should be integrated into the development workflow as follows:

1. **Pre-Implementation**: Review existing code before implementing new features to understand patterns and avoid inconsistencies.

2. **Post-Implementation**: Review new code after implementation to ensure it meets quality standards and integrates well with existing code.

3. **Pre-Release**: Conduct a comprehensive review before releasing to production to catch any issues that might affect users.

4. **Maintenance**: Schedule regular reviews as part of ongoing maintenance to prevent technical debt accumulation.

5. **Cloud Migration**: Use this review process before and after migrating components to the cloud architecture to ensure consistency and proper integration.
