# PokeData API Integration Findings

## API Discovery Process (May 2025)

After thorough testing and investigation, we've identified the key limitations and required workflow for the PokeData API:

### 1. Set Code Mismatch

We discovered a critical mismatch between Pokemon TCG API set codes and PokeData API set codes:

* **Pokemon TCG API** uses detailed codes like `sv8pt5` for Prismatic Evolutions
* **PokeData API** uses simpler codes like `sv8` for Super Electric Breaker

This mismatch makes direct set-to-set mapping challenging. Our test with `sv8` found a real set (Super Electric Breaker with 138 cards), but it was not the set we expected (Prismatic Evolutions).

### 2. Card Number Issues

Another limitation is card numbering mismatches. For example, we were looking for card #161 in a set, but:
* The set we found (Super Electric Breaker) only had 138 cards
* Our fallback method returned "Rayquaza Amazing Rare" with number 138, not the Umbreon ex we expected

### 3. Proper Workflow

The correct PokeData API workflow requires multiple steps:
1. Get all sets via `/sets` endpoint
2. Find the specific set by its code to get the set ID
3. Get all cards in that set using `/set?set_id=xxx`
4. Find the specific card by number to get the card ID
5. Get pricing data using `/pricing?id=xxx&asset_type=CARD`

### 4. Implemented Solution

Our implementation now properly handles these limitations:

1. **Primary Workflow**: Attempts the full, proper workflow first
   * Get sets → Find set ID → Get cards → Find card ID → Get pricing

2. **Fallback Mechanism**: Falls back to using just the card number
   * Uses `/pricing` with just card number
   * Includes warning logic to detect wrong card/set matches
   * Preserves system function while acknowledging potential inaccuracy

3. **Caching System**: Added extensive caching to minimize API calls
   * Sets cache (24-hour TTL)
   * Set-to-ID mapping cache
   * Cards-in-set cache (per set ID)

## Documentation Updates

We've also created comprehensive API documentation in `/docs/api-documentation.md` that details:
* Proper PokeData API endpoints
* Parameter formats and requirements
* Response structures
* Credit usage considerations

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to address these limitations:
1. Create a custom mapping table between Pokemon TCG API set codes and PokeData API set codes
2. Implement fuzzy matching for set codes
3. Consider adding feedback mechanism when pricing data might be for wrong card
